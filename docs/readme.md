# FreeFlow Events

Is Liberalism dead? Is there an alternative? The world has never been more global and prosperous, but so many people are unhappy. Our too capitalistic (rational mind driven) system is destroying our planet's resources and most people ignore this sad reality and go on with their lives like everything will stay the same as has been for the last 60 years. 

The world needs some healing and the time of talking is over, we want to connect people who want to act now and help heal the world. You are welcome to join us for any or all of the 5 days. There are more than 30 sessions and activities planned. 

We need a radical new approach, an approach which starts with ourselves and we need to realize that we can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them (Einstein).

**We have a 3-Fold plan which we believe can help the world to heal.**

1. We need a new system which allows us to freely communicate and collaborate, independent of where we live. This system needs to be globally available and affordable. We need to be able to communicate and consume information without being manipulated (by fear). All current systems are pyramids, we need a circular system which puts us in the center and gives us control over our information (data). We need to learn how to use this system and use or build applications on top, who will deliver us the same or even better level of convenience we now got used to.
2. We need a new kind of money, money is a taboo, we almost don’t know anything about it, yet it controls so much in our lives. We need new types of money which are more stable and more efficient and fair.
3. Change needs to start with ourselves. Our universe is a wonderful place, we know so little about it. Learning about our own capabilities and learning to use “love” over “fear” makes the world a better place. We need to learn how to say no to certain behaviors in the world and choose differently.
